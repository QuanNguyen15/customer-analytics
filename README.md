# Customer Analytics

Customer Analytics is a project aimed at analyzing customer data to provide insights, segment markets, and improve marketing strategies. Using machine learning and big data tools, the project processes large-scale data from CRM and e-commerce platforms to predict customer behavior and trends.

## Key Features
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Understand customer actions such as product preferences, purchasing habits, and engagement patterns.
- **Market Segmentation**: Use clustering algorithms to group customers into distinct segments based on behavior and purchasing history.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to forecast customer behavior, including churn prediction, repeat purchases, and product interest.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual reports to communicate insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Big Data Processing**: Leverage Hadoop and Spark for processing large-scale customer data.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Big Data**: Hadoop, Spark
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI

## Project Goals
- Gain insights into customer behavior to optimize business and marketing strategies.
- Improve product recommendations, promotions, and customer retention efforts through data-driven decision-making.

## How to Run
1. Prepare and load customer data from CRM or e-commerce platforms.
2. Process data using big data tools (Hadoop/Spark).
3. Run analysis scripts to extract insights and visualize data.
4. Apply machine learning models for behavior prediction and segmentation.

This project enables businesses to make informed decisions by deeply understanding customer behavior and market trends.



# Docker Setup Guide
This guide will walk you through setting up a Docker environment, copying data into a Docker volume, starting containers, and cleaning up Docker resources such as containers, images, volumes, and networks.
## 1. Create Docker Volume
First, create a Docker volume to store data:
```bash
docker volume create spark-data
```
## 2. Copy Data from Local Machine to the Volume
Run the following command to copy data from your local machine into the created Docker volume (`spark-data`):
```bash
docker run --rm -v spark-data:/data -v /d/Big_data/customer-analytics/data:/source alpine sh -c "cp -R /source/* /data/"
```
In this command:  
- `spark-data:/data` mounts the `spark-data` volume to the container's `/data` directory.  
- `/d/Big_data/customer-analytics/data:/source` mounts the local directory `/d/Big_data/customer-analytics/data` to the container's `/source` directory.  
- The `cp` command copies all files from `/source/` to `/data/`.
## 3. Start the Spark Container
Start your container using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.
## 4. Clean Up Docker Images and Containers
### 4.1. Check Running Containers
Before stopping or removing containers, check which ones are running:
```bash
docker ps
```
### 4.2. Stop Running Containers
Stop the running containers by using their `containerID`:
```bash
docker stop <containerID>
```
Replace `<containerID>` with the actual container ID from the previous step.
### 4.3. Remove Containers
Once the containers are stopped, remove them:
```bash
docker rm <containerID>
```
### 4.4. Remove Docker Images
Remove specific images by their `imageID`:
```bash
docker rmi <imageID> --force
```
The `--force` flag ensures that images are removed even if they are being used by stopped containers.
### 4.5. Remove Unused Images
Remove all unused images, including dangling ones:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```
This command will remove all unused images, not just dangling ones.
## 5. Remove Docker Volumes
To remove volumes, use the following command with the `volumeName`:
```bash
docker volume rm <volumeName>
```
Replace `<volumeName>` with the name of the volume you want to remove.
## 6. Remove Docker Networks
To remove networks, use the following command with the `networkName`:
```bash
docker network rm <networkName>
```
Replace `<networkName>` with the name of the network you want to remove.
## 7. Verify the Cleanup
After cleanup, you can verify that the images have been removed by running:
```bash
docker images
```
This command lists all remaining Docker images on your system.

You can now follow these instructions to manage your Docker environment effectively.
